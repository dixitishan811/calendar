feat: enhance calendar UI with background and border adjustments, and improve calendar event data handling

This commit refines the calendar UI by updating background colors and adding borders to enhance visual clarity, and improves event data handling. Key changes include:

-   Adjusted background colors in `MonthView` and `SwipeableCalendarView` to use `XCalendarTheme.colorScheme.onPrimary` and removed redundant surface color, and removed extra background
- Added a box on top of timeColumn in `BaseCalendarScreen`
-   Implemented custom borders for day cells in `SwipeableCalendarView`, improving the visual separation between days.
- Updated the `visibleCalendarIds` in `CalendarViewModel` to use the `+=` and `-=` operators for set addition and removal.
-   Renamed `TopAppBar.kt` to `CalendarTopAppBar.kt` for clarity.
- Updated day cell shape to rectangle if it's not a current day in `SwipeableCalendarView`
