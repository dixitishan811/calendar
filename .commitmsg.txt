feat: enhance calendar holiday display with expansion and improved animations

This commit enhances the display of holidays in the calendar view with the following changes:

-   **Holiday Tag Limit:** In the compact calendar view, only the first two holidays are now displayed, followed by a "+n more" indicator if more holidays exist.
-   **Expandable Holiday List:** Added the ability to expand the holiday list in the compact calendar view to show all holidays for a selected day.
- **Expand/Collapse Action** Added expand and collapse action on the holiday list.
-   **Improved Animations:** Adjusted the animation properties for the `BaseCalendarScreen`, changing `dampingRatio` to `Spring.DampingRatioHighBouncy` and `stiffness` to `Spring.StiffnessVeryLow` for a more dynamic animation.
