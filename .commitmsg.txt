feat: refactor navigation and date management in calendar views

This commit refactors the navigation and date management in the calendar views, enhancing the overall user experience and code maintainability. Key changes include:

-   Removing `ViewType` from `BaseCalendarScreen` and `DateStateHolder`.
-   Removing `viewType` from the date update method `updateSelectedDateState` in `DateStateHolder`.
-   Removing `viewType` in `onDateClick` callback in Month Screen.
-   Removing `viewType` from `updateSelectedDateState` method call in `BaseCalendarScreen`.
-   Updating `BaseCalendarScreen` to use `selectedDate` instead of `viewStartDate`.
-   Introducing a generic `onDateClickCallback` in `BaseCalendarScreen`, `DayScreen`, `ThreeDayScreen`, and `WeekScreen` to replace the specific date-based callback.
-   Removing the specific date parameter of `onDateClick` in `DayScreen`, `ThreeDayScreen`, and `WeekScreen`.
-   Updating `App` to use navigation routes for view selection instead of `currentView`.
-   Updating `CalendarDrawer` to use navigation route strings instead of `CalendarView` enums for view selection.
- Removing `selectView` method from `CalendarViewModel`.
- Updating `onDateClick` in `MonthScreen` to only call updateSelectedDateState without providing `viewType`.
- Removing unused helper methods (`getWeekStartDate`, `get3DayStartDate`, `getOneDayStartDate`) from `CalendarUiState`.
