feat: enhance date/time handling, improve time range display, and add state management for ScheduleScreen

This commit refactors date and time handling across the application, enhances the display of time ranges for events, and introduces robust state management for the `ScheduleScreen`. Key changes include:

-   **Refactored Date/Time Handling**:
    -   Removed redundant date-related functions from `YearMonth`.
    -   Introduced `parseDateTime` to `extensions.kt` for versatile date/time parsing from strings.
    -   Added `isLeap` extension to `Int` for improved leap year detection.

-   **Enhanced Time Range Display**:
    -   Implemented `formatTimeRange` to `extensions.kt` for clear and concise event time range formatting, replacing previous methods.

-   **ScheduleScreen State Management**:
    -   Introduced `ScheduleStateHolder` to `domain/states/scheduleState/ScheduleStateHolder.kt` to manage `ScheduleScreen`'s state, including scrolling and month/week/day display.
    -   Added `DateState` and `DateStateHolder` to `domain/states/dateState/` to handle overall date related state.
    -   Created `ScheduleItem` to `ui/screen/scheduleScreen/ScheduleItem.kt` for handling different item types in `ScheduleScreen`.
    - Updated `ScheduleScreen` to use `ScheduleStateHolder` for managing schedule state.
   - Updated `createScheduleItemsForMonthRange` to manage display of month, week and date related data on `ScheduleScreen`.

    -   Moved `noRippleClickable` and `customBorder` to `modifierExtension.kt`.
    -   Cleaned up `CalendarUiState` by removing unused methods.
    -   Refactored `MonthRange` to `ScheduleState` for clarity.
- Removed unused code like `ViewType` enum.
- Replaced `DateStateHolderImpl` with `DateStateHolder`.
- Replaced all old imports with updated imports.
- Added month range for displaying data on `ScheduleScreen`.
- Updated `DayWithEvents` to use updated `formatTimeRange`.
- Updated all relevant classes to use updated `DateStateHolder` and `DateState`.
- Added logic to update `topAppBar` with current viewed month on `ScheduleScreen`.
- Replaced `scheduleState` with `scheduleStateHolder` on `ScheduleScreen`.
- Updated `MonthView` to use updated `isLeap` method.
