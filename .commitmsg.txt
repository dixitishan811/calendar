feat: enhance event and holiday display with dynamic styling and improved UI

This commit introduces several enhancements to the display of events and holidays within the calendar views, focusing on improved styling, dynamic UI adjustments, and better information presentation.

Key changes include:

-   **EventTag Color Customization**: Introduced a `textColor` parameter in `EventTag` to allow better contrast and readability.
-   **BaseCalendarScreen Header Adjustment**: Implemented dynamic header height adjustment in `BaseCalendarScreen` based on the presence of holidays, using animation for a smoother transition.
-   **SwipeableCalendarView Header Refinement**: Enhanced the header in `SwipeableCalendarView` to display day names and numbers more clearly.
-   **SwipeableCalendarView Holiday Display**: Improved holiday display in `SwipeableCalendarView`, now showing holiday names directly in the header and using `EventTag` for consistent styling.
-   **DayCell Event and Holiday Tags**: Updated `DayCell` to use `EventTag` for consistent styling and improved readability, with correct text color contrast.
- **SwipeableCalendarView Holiday display**: Now showing multiple holidays and their name correctly in the header.
- **BaseCalendarScreen Header**: Updated base header to show multiple holiday.
-   **SwipeableCalendarView Holiday display**:Updated holiday tag to show text properly.
-   **SwipeableCalendarView Day Name length**: Now showing day names in 3 letter if `numDays` is less than equal to 3 and showing only 1 letter otherwise.
-   **SwipeableCalendarView Header**: Updated header height to `IntrinsicSize.Min`
