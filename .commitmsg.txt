refactor: improve CalendarViewModel state management and EventItem UI

This commit introduces two key changes:

1.  **CalendarViewModel State Debouncing:** A `debounce` operator with a 250-millisecond duration has been added to the `combine` flow in `CalendarViewModel`. This prevents rapid, successive UI updates when multiple underlying flows (users, holidays, calendars, events) emit values in quick succession, leading to a smoother user experience.

2.  **EventItem UI Simplification:**
    *   The calculation for `eventWidth` and `horizontalOffset` in `SwipeableCalendarView` has been removed. Event items will now occupy the full width of the day column.
    *   The custom drawing logic for overlapping events (diagonal hatching) has been removed from `EventItem`. The visual distinction for overlapping events now relies solely on the alpha value of the background color.
