refactor: code cleanup and minor adjustments

This commit includes minor code cleanup and adjustments:

-   **`ScheduleScreen.kt`**: Changed the caught exception variable name from `e` to `_` in a `try-catch` block to indicate it's intentionally unused.
-   **`App.kt`**: Removed an unused import `androidx.compose.ui.semantics.semantics`.
-   **Domain Models (`Holiday.kt`, `Event.kt`)**: Removed trailing commas in data class definitions.
-   **`MonthView.kt` & `ScheduleStateHolder.kt`**: Reordered imports.
