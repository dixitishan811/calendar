feat: enhance date and view management, and refine UI components

This commit includes several enhancements and refinements to date and view management, along with UI improvements. Key changes are:

-   **Update View Management**: Modified `updateSelectedDateState` in `DateStateHolder` to consider the `viewType` (MONTH_VIEW, WEEK_VIEW, THREE_DAY_VIEW, ONE_DAY_VIEW) when updating the `viewStartDate`.
-   **Introduce ViewType**: Added `ViewType` enum to differentiate between various calendar views.
-   **Integrate ViewType in Screens**: Incorporated `viewType` in `DayScreen` and `ThreeDayScreen` for proper date updates.
-   **Update CalendarTopAppBar**: Updated `CalendarTopAppBar` to include events and holidays, show year conditionally and to update date based on view type.
-   **Improve BaseCalendarScreen**: Updated `BaseCalendarScreen` to take `viewType` as a parameter and pass it to the `updateSelectedDateState` function.
-   **Refine MonthScreen**: Updated `MonthScreen` to update date based on month view type.
-   **Refine WeekScreen**: Updated `WeekScreen` to set view type.
-   **Update SwipeableCalendarView**: Updated `SwipeableCalendarView` to remove redundant comments.
-   **Refine Theme**: Refined Theme to remove unused imports.
-  **Update Calendar Ui State**: Updated `getOneDayStartDate` in `CalendarUiState`.
-  **Update Calendar Drawer**: Updated `CalendarDrawer` to remove comments.
- **Refine Event Display**: Updated event display in `SwipeableCalendarView` to remove event alpha.
