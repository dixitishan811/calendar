docs: add screenshots and demo gifs to README

This commit updates the `README.md` file to include a comprehensive "Screenshots & Demo" section.

This new section showcases the application's user interface and functionality on both Android and iOS platforms using embedded images and GIFs. It is organized into the following categories:

-   **App Overview:** Provides general demo GIFs for both platforms.
-   **Calendar Views:** Displays screenshots of Month, Week, Day, 3-Day, and Schedule views.
-   **Event Management:** Shows screenshots for adding and viewing events.
-   **Navigation & UI:** Includes screenshots of the App Bar and Sidebar.

All images are sourced from the `assets/screenshots/` directory within the project's GitHub repository.
