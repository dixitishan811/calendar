feat: refactor SwipeableCalendarView to display holidays with EventTag and enhance UI

This commit refactors the `SwipeableCalendarView` component to improve the display of holidays and enhance the overall UI. Key changes include:

-   **Move `EventTag`:** Moved the `EventTag` composable from `monthScreen` to `ui.components` to make it a common UI component.
-   **Holiday Display:** Implemented holiday display in the day headers using the `EventTag` component.
-   **Dynamic Header Height:** Introduced dynamic height for the day headers, expanding to accommodate the holiday tag when a day has a holiday.
-   **Header Height Animation:** Added a smooth animation for the day header height changes when switching between days with and without holidays.
-   **UI Enhancements:** Improved the visual layout and spacing of the day headers and their content.
-   **Code Refactor:** Cleaned up and reorganized code for better readability and maintainability.
- **Minor Bug Fix:** Added `clickable` Modifier inside of `Box` in `DateHeader` Composable to fix click issue.
- **New Dependency:** Added `androidx.compose.animation:animation` in `libs.versions.toml` to use `animateContentSize` function.
