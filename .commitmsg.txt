feat: Fetch and store calendars, events, and holidays from remote sources

This commit introduces the functionality to fetch calendar data (calendars, events, and holidays) from remote API services and store it in the local database.

Key changes include:

- Updated `RemoteCalendarApiService` to fetch events based on a list of calendar IDs instead of a single ID.
- Modified `HolidayRepository` to include a function `updateHolidays` that fetches holidays from `HolidayApiService` and inserts them into the database.
- Enhanced `EventRepository` with a `getEventsForCalendar` function to fetch events from `RemoteCalendarApiService` and add them to the database.
- Updated `CalendarRepository` to include `getCalendersForUser` which fetches calendars from `RemoteCalendarApiService` and upserts them into the database. Also changed `upsertCalendar` to accept a list of calendars.
- Added `asHolidayEntity()` extension function for `HolidayItem` in `holidayExtension.kt` to facilitate mapping from remote DTO to local entity.
- Modified `CalendarDao`'s `upsertCalendar` to accept a list of `CalendarEntity`.
- Refactored `CalendarViewModel` to initialize and combine flows for holidays, calendars, and events to manage the UI state. The data fetching logic is now integrated into the repository functions.
