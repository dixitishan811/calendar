feat: implement Compose Navigation for Calendar Views

This commit introduces navigation between different calendar views (Month, Week, Day, ThreeDay, Schedule) using Jetpack Compose's Navigation component. Key changes include:

-   **Navigation Implementation:** Added `NavHost` and `composable` functions to manage navigation between calendar views in `App.kt`.
-   **Navigation Controller:** Utilized `rememberNavController` to control navigation.
-   **View Navigation:** Integrated `navController.navigate()` to switch between views when a user selects a view or clicks a date/event.
-   **Dependency Update:** Updated the `navigation-compose` dependency to version 2.9.0-alpha16 in `libs.versions.toml`.
- **Code Refactoring:** Move every view to its own composable destination.
- **Code Refactoring:** Update navigation logic.
-   **Dependency Update:** updated the `androidx-activityCompose` dependency to version 1.10.0-alpha01 in `libs.versions.toml`.
-   **Dependency Update:** updated the `androidx-lifecycle` dependency to version 2.8.0-alpha01 in `libs.versions.toml`.
