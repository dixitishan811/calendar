refactor: update string to color conversion for lighter, pastel colors

The `convertStringToColor` extension function has been updated to generate lighter, pastel colors from input strings.

- If the input string is empty, it now returns a light gray color (0xFFF0F0F0) instead of black.
- The RGB component calculation now uses a base value of 180 and a modulo of 75 to ensure the generated colors are lighter and fall within a pastel range, improving visual distinction.
