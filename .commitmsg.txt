fix: rename stringToColor to convertStringToColor and enhance color generation

This commit renames the `stringToColor` extension function to `convertStringToColor` for clarity.

Additionally, the color generation logic in `calendarExtension.kt` and `eventExtension.kt` has been improved to use a combination of `id` and `name` (or `calendarId` and `calenderName` for events) to generate more unique colors, reducing the likelihood of color collisions.

The `EventResponseItem`'s `calenderName` property is now nullable to handle potential null values from the data source. The `assets/events.json` file has been updated to reflect this change, ensuring consistency.
