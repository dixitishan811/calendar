refactor: remove SharedTransitionLayout and update HolidayRepository data fetching

This commit introduces two main changes:

1.  **SharedTransitionLayout Removal:**
    *   The `LocalSharedTransitionScope` composition local and the `SharedTransitionLayout` wrapper around the `NavHost` in `App.kt` have been removed. This simplifies the navigation setup and removes dependencies on `ExperimentalSharedTransitionApi`.

2.  **HolidayRepository Data Fetching Logic Update:**
    *   In `HolidayRepository`, the commented-out code for inserting holidays fetched from the remote API into the local DAO has been uncommented. This ensures that fetched holidays are persisted locally.
    *   In `CalendarViewModel`, the `initializeHolidays` function now first attempts to fetch holidays from the local repository using `holidayRepository.getHolidaysForYear`. If the local data is empty, it then proceeds to fetch from the remote API using `holidayRepository.updateHolidays`.
    *   The initialization order in `initializeData` has been slightly adjusted, grouping `initializeUsers`, `initializeCalendars`, and `initializeEvents` into one `async` block.
