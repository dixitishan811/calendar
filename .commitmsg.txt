refactor: improve event dialogs and interaction

This commit introduces significant changes to how event creation and details are displayed, moving them into `ModalBottomSheet` components for a more modern UI feel.

**Key Changes:**

-   **Event Creation Dialog (`AddEventDialog`):**
    -   Now presented within a `ModalBottomSheet` triggered by the Floating Action Button in `App.kt`.
    -   `onDismiss` in the dialog's header now correctly calls the passed `onDismiss` lambda.
    -   `MutableInteractionSource` is now used for the title `TextField` to potentially enable more advanced interaction handling in the future.

-   **Event Details Dialog (`EventDetailsDialog`):**
    -   Refactored from an `AlertDialog` to a custom `Column` composable, designed to be shown within a `ModalBottomSheet`.
    -   The dialog is now triggered when an event is clicked in any calendar view (`MonthScreen`, `DayScreen`, `ThreeDayScreen`, `WeekScreen`) and shows up as a bottom sheet.
    -   **UI Overhaul:**
        -   The layout is completely redesigned to match common calendar app aesthetics.
        -   Includes a close (X) icon and an edit icon in the header row.
        -   Event color is now displayed as a small colored square next to the title.
        -   The title is displayed with `FontWeight.Medium`.
        -   A new `formatEventSubheading` function is introduced to create a more descriptive subheading (e.g., "Friday, 20 Jun 6-7PM" or "Friday, 20 Jun" for all-day events, including recurring information like "Repeat every week").
        -   Sections for "Join with Google Meet" (placeholder), location (if available), reminder time (placeholder "10 minutes before"), and guest list information (placeholder) are added with icons.
        -   The event description is now displayed with an icon and proper alignment.
    -   The "Delete" and "Edit" actions, previously `TextButton`s in the `AlertDialog`, are now handled by the header icons and the `onEdit` and `onDelete` lambdas. The "Close" button is replaced by the header's close icon and the bottom sheet's dismiss behavior.

-   **App.kt Integration:**
    -   `showAddBottomSheet` and `showDetailsBottomSheet` state variables are introduced to control the visibility of the respective bottom sheets.
    -   Clicking an event in any calendar view now sets the `selectedEvent` in the `viewModel` and sets `showDetailsBottomSheet` to `true`.
    -   The `FloatingActionButton` now sets `showAddBottomSheet` to `true`.
    -   `ModalBottomSheet` is used to host both `AddEventDialog` and `EventDetailsDialog`.
    -   When `EventDetailsDialog` is dismissed or an action (edit/delete) is taken, `showDetailsBottomSheet` is set to `false` and the `selectedEvent` in the `viewModel` is cleared.

These changes provide a more integrated and visually appealing way to manage event interactions within the application.
