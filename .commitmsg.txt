refactor: update AddEventDialog and EventRepository for improved event management

This commit refactors the `AddEventDialog` to be used within a `ModalBottomSheet` and removes the `showAddEventDialog` state from `CalendarUiState`. The dialog's save and dismiss logic is now handled externally.

Additionally, the `EventRepository.getEventsForCalendarsInRange` method has been updated to filter events by `userId` instead of a list of `calendarIds`.
